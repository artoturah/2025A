					"description": "This course introduces you to the foundational concepts of network security, essential for protecting systems and data from unauthorized access and attacks. You'll explore the core principles of network security, such as the importance of encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. You'll also learn how different network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) function and how vulnerabilities in these protocols can be exploited by cyber attackers. Topics covered include types of network attacks (such as man-in-the-middle, denial of service, and spoofing), common security measures like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and the significance of strong password policies. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how to identify potential threats and safeguard a network against malicious activity.",
